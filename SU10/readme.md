It is used to perform USER ADMINISTRATION tasks for multiple users at once,instead of doing them one by one in SU01.

This folder contains practice screenshots for SU10 T-Code:

- Lock/Unlock multiple users
  
- Assign Roles to multiple users
  
- Delete users in bulk
  
- Password reset for multiple users

SU10 has 3 tabs

**1. Address data:** Used to manage and update general user information, such as name, title, department, building, room number, telephone, and email address.

**2. Authorization data:** Used to manage the authorizations, roles, and profiles assigned to the selected users. This is where you grant or revoke access rights.

**3. Logon data:** Used to manage the user's logon-specific details, such as the user type, initial password, validity dates (from/to), and whether the user is locked or unlocked.
