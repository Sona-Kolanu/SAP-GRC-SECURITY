# SUGR - User Group Maintenance

SUGR tcode helps to organize users for easy maintenanance.Easy to search/filter users by user groups in SUIM reports.Without user groups system becomes messy,risk, and hard to control.

We have 2 types of user groups functional wise and locational wise

**FUNCTIONAL WISE (Module wise)**

SAP MM

**Using SUGR,we can --**

- Create a new user group
  
- Change existing user group
  
- Delete user group
  
- Display user group in SAP

We have special user groups

**1. TERMINATE** --> It is for leavers (who are not working in our company)

**2. SUPER** --> If a user is having extra access/authorizations to perform advanced tasks.

**3. EXTERNAL** --> External users are not our company employees(contractors,vendors,consultants),they need temporary access to SAP project or support work.We create a special group to separate them from employees.
